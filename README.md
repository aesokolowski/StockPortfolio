## Stock Portfolio web app

Issues:
  -- in order to get a updated portfolio data, usually you need to hit
     reload.  The transactions component doesn't seem to have this problem.
     It worked the old way before I implemented loading portfolios from the
     backend, go back a few commits before the portfolio database is
     created
  -- did not have time to implement getting the latest price from the
     API, nor use that info for color coding the day's progress
